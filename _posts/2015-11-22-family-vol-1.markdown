# Parents

### Parents are crucial to your growth in life. They take you on spiritual and educating adventures. Parents are like directors in a play; they can make your life better by adding details, but they cannot change your whole life script. They are very important to your life for the following. Parents are the most influential adults in children's lives. As children we all need a role model who can show us what to do and give us opinions on who we want to be. Parents are usually our role models from the very beginning because they show us unconditional love and compassion. Next, they are there to talk to you and to be around you. Parents want to understand you more as you grow older especially if society has changed you and exposed you to new things that you would like to share. This day and age, where everything is moving quickly, we need someone in our life who can really take their time and teach us how to de-stress. Lastly, as children develop they need specific opinions and guidance from a parent. As a kid myself, knowing that someone I trust is always there to talk to me makes me feel very secure.
